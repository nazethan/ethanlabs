### **Aim**
> To demonstrate the use of aggregate functions i.e., min, max, count, sum, and average

### **Theory**
Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. They are often used with the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL to group the result set by one or more columns.

- **Min and Max:**
  > The `MIN()` function returns the smallest value in a set, while the `MAX()` function returns the largest value.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
  SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Count, Sum, and Average:**
  > The `COUNT()` function returns the number of rows that match a specified condition, the `SUM()` function returns the total sum of a numeric column, and the `AVG()` function returns the average value of a numeric column.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
  SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
  SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
  ```

### **Commands**
```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS MinimumSalary FROM Employees; 
SELECT MAX(salary) AS MaximumSalary FROM Employees;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employees;
SELECT SUM(salary) AS TotalSalary FROM Employees;
SELECT AVG(salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees;
```

### **Conclusion**
> Successfully demonstrated the use of various aggregate functions in SQL, including `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()`
