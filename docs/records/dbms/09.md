### **Aim**
> To demonstrate the use of aggregate functions i.e., like, wildcards, in, and between

### **Theory**
Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. They are often used with the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL to group the result set by one or more columns.

- **Like:**
  > The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
  ```

- **Wildcards:**
  > The `%` wildcard represents zero or more characters, while the `_` wildcard represents a single character.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'a%'; -- Finds any values that start with "a"
  SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '_a%'; -- Finds any values that have "a" in the second position
  ```

- **In:**
  > The `IN` operator allows you to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
  ```

- **Between:**
  > The `BETWEEN` operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
  ```

### **Commands**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE name LIKE '_a%';
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Finance');
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000;
```

### **Conclusion**
> Successfully demonstrated the use of various aggregate functions in SQL, including `LIKE`, wildcards, `IN`, and `BETWEEN`
