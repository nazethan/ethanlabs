### **Aim**
> To write SQL queries for table creation and modification

### **Theory**
- [Create Table](https://www.w3schools.com/MySQL/mysql_create_table.asp) // write from the link...
- [Alter Table](https://www.w3schools.com/MySQL/mysql_alter.asp) // write from the link...

- **Rename Table**
  > This command is used to change the name of an existing table in the database. It allows us to give a new name to the table while keeping all its data and structure intact. <br /> 
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;
  ```

- **Truncate Table**
  > This command is used to delete all the data from a table while keeping the structure of the table intact. It is faster than the DELETE command as it does not log individual row deletions. <br />
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
  ```
- **Drop Table**
  > This command is used to completely remove a table from the database, including all its data and structure. Once a table is dropped, it cannot be recovered. <br />
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  DROP TABLE table_name;
  ```


### **Commands**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Email VARCHAR(100);

ALTER TABLE Employees
MODIFY Age SMALLINT;

ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP COLUMN Department;

RENAME TABLE Employees TO Staff;
TRUNCATE TABLE Staff;
DROP TABLE Staff;
```

### **Conclusion**
> Successfully implemented Data Definition Language (DDL) commands
