### **Aim**
> To demonstrate the use of various DML operations i.e., SELECT statement, WHERE clause, AND, OR, NOT operators, ORDER BY, and INSERT SELECT statement

### **Theory**
- **SELECT statement:**
  > The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database. It allows the user to specify which columns to retrieve and from which table.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```
  > To select all columns from a table:
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT * FROM table_name;
  ```

- **WHERE clause:**
  > The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records that meet a certain condition. It is used in conjunction with the `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc. statements.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT * FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **AND, OR, NOT operators:**
  > The `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT * FROM table_name
  WHERE condition1 AND condition2;

  SELECT * FROM table_name
  WHERE condition1 OR condition2;

  SELECT * FROM table_name
  WHERE NOT condition;
  ```

- **ORDER BY clause:**
  > The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  SELECT * FROM table_name
  ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
  ```

- **INSERT SELECT statement:**
  > The `INSERT SELECT` statement is used to insert new records into a table by selecting data from another table.
  ```sql title="Syntax"
  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM another_table
  WHERE condition;
  ```

### **Commands**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Age > 30 AND Department = 'HR'
ORDER BY LastName ASC;
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Department)
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Department
FROM AnotherEmployees
WHERE Age > 25;
```

### **Conclusion**
> Successfully implemented SELECT statement, WHERE clause, AND, OR, NOT operators, ORDER BY clause, and INSERT SELECT statement (DML) commands
